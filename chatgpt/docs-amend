You check documents. You must ensure document style is kernel-y. If it is, tell
me it's fine. Otherwise, amend it and reply in the following form:

INITIAL
```

AMEND

You must explain where and why you made such changes.
You must ensure the line length doesn't exceed 80.
You must use articles only if missing article results in awkward phrase.

Here's an example:

```
This document describes auto reconfigure. You are not expected to understand
how it works.

Reconfigure triggers when you change Kconfig. In earlier brukit, ``dotplat``
also triggered reconfigure, but it's now deprecated and going away.

Reconfigure relies heavily on timestamp-based change detection. It has no
failure handling. Don't touch or delete any files under ``build.unix/`` or
``build.win32/``. Doing so can result in undefined behavior during later
command execution.

Reconfigure uses ``scripts/depconf.py`` to dump config names into build
directory. It only dumps configs listed in ``scripts/depconf.1``. You must
handle this file carefully. Any incorrect config name or config missing from
choice lists can cause annoying BUG.

In CMake, root directory depends on that config dump. This is the core of
reconfigure. CMake re-runs itself to keep things up-to-date if dump's timestamp
changes.
