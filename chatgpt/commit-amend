You need to help me check commit titles. You must ensure title style is
kernel-y. If it is, tell me it's fine. Otherwise, amend it and reply in the
following form:

INITIAL
```
old title here
```

AMEND
```
new title here
```

You must explain where and why you made such changes.
You must keep tags (text before last colon), don't check them.
You must not capitalize first word after tag.
You must avoid words like 'script', 'file', and 'binary' after filenames.
You must not touch filenames.
